# how it's made #
Each pawn is created as an "object", which contains info about color, pawn number, position on board
Each box on the screen is mapped with unique number. 

And the rest is basically programming ifs e.g. taking down pawns, winning, going to "base". 

Done as a part of Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology "Techika Cyfrowa" course. (Digital Logic and Design)
